After you have mastered the skills of flying an RC toys, and you still feel the need for an even greater drenalin rush, for example, after you bought the [V912 RC helicopter](http://www.iu-model.com/mod_product-view-p_id-451.html), there are some very important pointers to keep you from becoming discouraged with the complexity of helicopter flight, and some recommendations that will keep the hobby from blowing a hole in your wallet.

There are many things you should consider before you purchase your first [V912 RC helicopter](http://www.iu-model.com/mod_product-view-p_id-451.html), you will find that it is very important to learn everything you possibly can about how the helicopter works. What mechanisms surrounding the main rotor cause it to go forward, backward, left and right. Just believe me, it is durable for beginners, and it’s always funnier to fly outdoor, we took it to the park with light breeze, it flew beautifully, we have never seen a bell
rotor head perform so well outdoor.

After a few minutes, i loved everything about this bird. Compared with others, it is extremely stable, we noticed that right the way when we start hovering, for the price it’s unbeatable, and it’s so durable and well built, all sounds too good to be true. Bigger helicopter is better outdoor. We call this size the mini size, about the size of a computer keyboard, it has heavier blades and longer flybar to increase stability, that makes the [V912 RC helicopter](http://www.iu-model.com/mod_product-view-p_id-451.html) so stable and
wind resistance. But what you should pay attention to is that it is a bit too large to do anything other than hover a bit in the house, if you hit something you could break it or the helicopter.

In a word, the [V912 RC helicopter](http://www.iu-model.com/mod_product-view-p_id-451.html) is well built, very stabile and easy to fly. And it is also very strong, with more nock resistance than I expected.in a word, it is a funny toy.
